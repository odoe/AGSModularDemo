 * This is the build file I have started using
 * to build my ArcGIS JS API 3.0 apps, which are
 * based on Dojo 1.7. I used a similar build file
 * when I was using Require.js, so it wasn't much different.
 *
 * I tried using the Dojo Build Tools, but it just seemed
 * way too bloated to download the Dojo SDK, sort my files,
 * blah blah blah. With r.js I can use Node NPM to
 * npm install requirejs and just use the following command
 * r.js -o src/js/app.build.js
 * Done and done!
 *
 * This build file is meant to be used with r.js
 * http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html
 *
 * For more details on options, you can review
 * the sample r.js build file
 * https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/build/example.build.js
